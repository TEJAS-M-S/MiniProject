Mini project Based on Waste Trash Bin Segregation of waste
SMART WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM : AUTOMATION SEGREGATION AND REAL-TIME MONITORING 
The Smart Waste Management System project is designed to address the growing need for efficient and intelligent waste management solutions in urban environments. By leveraging modern technology, this system automates the segregation of waste into categories such as wet, dry, and metallic, optimizing the recycling and disposal processes. Equipped with various sensors, including ultrasonic, IR, soil moisture, and metal detectors, the system provides real-time monitoring and accurate waste bin status updates via an LCD display. 

Buzzer alerts notify personnel when bins are full, ensuring timely collection and preventing overflow. This innovative approach aims to enhance urban cleanliness, promote sustainability, and streamline waste management operations, contributing to a cleaner and more efficient urban environment.To address these challenges, this project presents a "Smart Waste Management System" designed to automate waste segregation and provide real-time monitoring of waste levels, thereby enhancing efficiency and sustainability in waste management practices.


1. Automate Waste Segregation: The system uses advanced sensors to automatically sort waste into wet, dry, and metallic categories. This improves the efficiency and accuracy of recycling processes by ensuring waste is correctly categorized without manual intervention.

2. Real-Time Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of waste bin levels is provided through an LCD display. This allows for immediate updates on the status of the bins, ensuring that waste management personnel can respond promptly to avoid overflows.

3. Timely Alerts: Buzzer notifications are used to alert personnel when waste bins are full. This system prevents overflow by ensuring that bins are emptied in a timely manner, maintaining the cleanliness and orderliness of the area.

4. Enhance Urban Cleanliness: By streamlining the waste management process, the system helps keep urban environments cleaner. This contributes to improved public health by reducing the risks associated with improperly managed waste.

 5. Promote Sustainability: The system encourages proper waste disposal and recycling practices. By efficiently managing waste segregation and collection, it supports environmental conservation efforts and promotes a sustainable approach to waste management.
